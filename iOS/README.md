MTGChatBot (iOS)

📱 Purpose

MTGChatBot is an AI-powered chatbot for Magic: The Gathering players. Built for iOS, the app allows users to get quick, accurate details about MTG cards, including:

- Card text and general data
- Rules interactions
- Set availability

MTGChatBot leverages the public Scryfall API to provide up-to-date Magic: The Gathering card information. Users can interact using voice or text, making the app fast, hands-free, and fun.
